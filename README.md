# ICG
Interactive Computer Graphics, 2020 Spring at NTU by Prof. Ming Ouhyoung

These demos are implemented in WebGL 2.0 with [observable notebooks](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/user-manual) as the [ICG collection](https://observablehq.com/collection/@learningstud/icg).

- [Homework 1](https://observablehq.com/@learningstud/homework-1-b05902035-ntu-edu-tw?collection=@learningstud/icg).
  - Basic requirement:
    1. One scene with at least 3 objects and 3 light sources, e.g., 3 [teapots](teapot.json).
    2. Implement the [Phong reflection model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phong_reflection_model), i.e., linearly combine ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting.
    3. Implement [flat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shading#Flat_shading), [Gouraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gouraud_shading), and [Phong shading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phong_shading).
    4. Exhibit translation, scaling, rotation, and shear on object(s).
  - Bonus:
    1. Allow the user to control the four transformations on object(s).
    2. Allow the user to control one's perspective.
    3. Allow the user to set the position and/or color of the light source(s).
    4. Implement other lighting and/or shading algorithm(s).
    5. Other special effects, e.g., animation, shadow, and transparency.
